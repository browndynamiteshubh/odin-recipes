    <h2>Description :</h2>
    <p>You'll only need five ingredients to make these irresistible deep-fried Oreos: vegetable oil (for frying and for the batter), milk, an egg, pancake mix, and a package of Oreos (regular and Double Stuf Oreos both work great).
         Try different Oreo flavors to switch things up!</p>
    <p>These fried Oreos are best eaten the day they're made. However, if you have leftovers, you can store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to three days.</p>

    <h4>Editor's Note :</h4>
    <p>We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention value of 10% after cooking. 
        Amount will vary depending on cooking time and temperature, ingredient density, and specific type of oil used.</p>
